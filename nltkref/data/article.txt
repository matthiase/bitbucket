HollywoodLife.com has exclusive inside info on where Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries’s wedding guests are booking their rooms! Her godfather has already been confirmed for the weekend!
The Four Seasons Resort, also known as The Biltmore, is a gorgeous property in Montecito and we spoke to a source who tells us Kim Kardashian has blocked all of the hotel rooms there for the weekend of her wedding to Kris Humphries! In fact, guests received special codes on their invitations to be able to book rooms. But will her Aug. 20 wedding take place there as well?

We have yet to receive confirmation about where Kim and Kris will say “I do”, but it’s entirely possible their wedding would be filmed at the Four Seasons. Santa Barbara is a beautiful backdrop for weddings, and many nuptials are held at the famous Biltmore resort.

A spokesperson said “no comment” when we asked whether the ceremony and reception would be held at the Four Seasons.

For now, we know that guests have already started to book their rooms for the weekend extravaganza. Kim’s godfather, Irving Azoff, has already confirmed his suite, where he is staying with his wife, for Aug 18 – 22. It’s not surprising that Kim’s wedding celebration will encompass more than one night!

Do you think The Biltmore is a perfect location for Kim’s huge wedding? Are you excited to see her walk down the aisle? Sound off below!
